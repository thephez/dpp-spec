# Identity Overview

Identities are a low-level construct that provide the foundation for user-facing functionality on the platform. An identity is a public key (or set of public keys) recorded on the platform chain that can be used to prove ownership of data.

Identities consist of three components that are described in further detail in following sections:

| Field | Type | Description|
| - | - | - |
| id | string (base58) | The identity id |
| type | integer | Type of identity (`user` or `application`) |
| publicKeys | array of keys | Public key(s) associated with the identity |


Each identity must comply with this JSON-Schema definition established in [js-dpp](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/schema/identity/public-key.json):

```json
{
  "$id": "https://schema.dash.org/dpp-0-4-0/identity/identity",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 42,
      "maxLength": 44,
      "pattern": "^[123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz]+$"
    },
    "type": {
      "type": "number",
      "multipleOf": 1.0,
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 65535
    },
    "publicKeys": {
      "type": "array",
      "minItems": 1,
      "maxItems": 100
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "id",
    "type",
    "publicKeys"
  ]
}
```

## Identity id

The identity `id` is calculated by Base58 encoding the double sha256 hash of the [outpoint](https://dashcore.readme.io/docs/core-additional-resources-glossary#section-outpoint) used to fund the identity creation.

`id = base58(sha256(sha256(<identity create funding output>)))`

### Example id creation
```javascript
// From the JavaScript reference implementation (js-dpp)
// IdentityCreateTransition.js
    this.identityId = bs58.encode(
      hash(Buffer.from(lockedOutPoint, 'base64')),
    );
```

## Identity type

**Note:** Identity types will be deprecated in a future release

Identities are separated into multiple types depending on their purpose.

| Value | Identity Type | Description |
| :-: | :-: | - |
| 1 | User | Standard identity type for using the platform |
| 2 | Application | Used to create data contracts |
| 3 -<br>32767 | N/A | Reserved |

## Identity publicKeys

The identity `publicKeys` array stores information regarding each public key associated with the identity. Each identity must have at least one public key.

Each item in the `publicKeys` array consists an object containing:

| Field | Type | Description|
| - | - | - |
| id | integer | The key id (`=> 1`, unique among keys in `publicKeys` array) |
| type | integer | Type of key (default: 1 - ECDSA) |
| data | string (base64) | Public key |
| isEnabled | boolean | Status of key |

Each identity public key must comply with this JSON-Schema definition established in [js-dpp](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/schema/identity/public-key.json):

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "$id": "https://schema.dash.org/dpp-0-4-0/identity/public-key",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "number",
      "multipleOf": 1.0,
      "minimum": 1
    },
    "type": {
      "type": "number",
      "enum": [1]
    },
    "data": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 2048,
      "pattern": "^(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{4})*(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{2}==|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{3}=)?$"
    },
    "isEnabled": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "id",
    "type",
    "data",
    "isEnabled"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### Public Key `id`

Each public key in an identity's `publicKeys` array must be assigned a unique index number (`id`).

**Note:** In the current implementation, each `id` must be `=> 1`.

### Public Key `type`

The `type` field indicates the algorithm used to derive the key.

| Type | Description |
| :-: | - |
| 1 | ECDSA (default) |
| 2 | BLS |

### Public Key `data`

The `data` field contains the compressed public key encoded as base64.

#### Example data encode/decode

**Encode**
```javascript
// From the JavaScript reference implementation (js-dpp)
// AbstractStateTransition.js
  /* We store compressed public key in the identity as a base64 string... */
  pubKeyBase = new PublicKey({
    ...privateKeyModel.toPublicKey().toObject(),
    compressed: true,
  })
    .toBuffer()
    .toString('base64');
```

**Decode**
```javascript
// From the JavaScript reference implementation (js-dpp)
// validatePublicKeysFactory.js
        const dataHex = Buffer.from(publicKey.data, 'base64').toString('hex');
```

### Public Key `isEnabled`

The `isEnabled` field indicates whether or not the key is an active, valid key. Setting this to `false` will disable the key.

**Note:** Keys are disabled (rather than deleted) to ensure that signature verification is possible for any data they signed.


# Identity Creation

Identities are created on the platform by submitting the identity information in an identity create state transition.

| Field | Type | Description|
| - | - | - |
| protocolVersion | integer | The platform protocol version (currently `0`) |
| type | integer | State transition type (`3` for identity create) |
| lockedOutPoint | string | Lock [outpoint]([https://dashcore.readme.io/docs/core-additional-resources-glossary#section-outpoint](https://dashcore.readme.io/docs/core-additional-resources-glossary#section-outpoint)) from the layer 1 locking transaction |
| identityType | integer | [Type of identity](#identity-type) |
| publicKeys | array of keys | [Public key(s)](#identity-publickeys) associated with the identity |
| signaturePublicKeyId | number | The `id` of the public key that signed the state transition (not part of the identity create state transition) |
| signature | string | Signature of state transition data |

**Note:** The lock transaction that creates the `lockedOutPoint` is not covered in this document. The preliminary design simply uses an `OP_RETURN` output.

Each identity must comply with this JSON-Schema definition established in [js-dpp](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/schema/identity/public-key.json) (in addition to the state transition [base schema](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/schema/stateTransition/base.json) that is required for all state transitions):

```json
{
  "$id": "https://schema.dash.org/dpp-0-4-0/idenitity/state-transitions/identity-create",
  "properties": {
    "lockedOutPoint": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 48,
      "maxLength": 48,
      "pattern": "^(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{4})*(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{2}==|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{3}=)?$"
    },
    "identityType": {
      "type": "number",
      "multipleOf": 1.0,
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 65535
    },
    "publicKeys": {
      "type": "array",
      "minItems": 1,
      "maxItems": 10
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "lockedOutPoint",
    "identityType",
    "publicKeys"
  ]
}
```

**Example State Transition**

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 0,
  "type": 3,
  "lockedOutPoint": "6NnSpFNGO9RmTl/joS9Bow64fE1YASEV+nv/4DnH0RsAAAAA",
  "identityType": 1,  
  "publicKeys": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": 1,
      "data": "A6AJAfRJyKuNoNvt33ygYfYh6OIYA8tF1s2BQcRA9RNg",
      "isEnabled": true
    }
  ],
  "signaturePublicKeyId": 1,  
  "signature": "IAN3MdbBZAU9Llpt8scGj11fAlJVOHj1Cfc/HAZrlE/Uf2IeD9nweGkUC3SULAnF1oIxfK7yndoOwLuvP8TLCwc=",
}
```

## Identity Create State Transition Signing

**Note:** The identity create state transition signature is unique in that it must be signed by the private key used in the layer 1 locking transaction. All other state transitions will be signed by a private key of the identity submitting them.

The process to sign an identity create state transition consists of the following steps:
1. Canonical CBOR encode the state transition data - this include all ST fields except the `signature` and `signaturePublicKeyId`
2. Sign the encoded data with private key associated with a lock transaction public key
3. Set the state transition `signature` to the base64 encoded value of the signature created in the previous step
4. Set the state transition`signaturePublicKeyId` to the [public key `id`](#public-key-id) corresponding to the key used to sign

### Code snipits related to signing
```javascript
// From js-dpp
// AbstractStateTransition.js
// Serialize encodes the object (excluding the signature-related fields) with canonical CBOR
const data = this.serialize({ skipSignature: true });
this.signature = sign(data, privateKeyModel).toString('base64');

// From dashcore-lib
// signer.js
/**
* @param {Buffer} data
* @param {string|PrivateKey} privateKey
* @return {Buffer}
*/
function sign(data, privateKey) {
	var hash = doubleSha(data);
	return signHash(hash, privateKey);
}

/**
* Sign hash.
* @param {Buffer} hash
* @param {string|PrivateKey} privateKey
* @return {Buffer} - 65-bit compact signature
*/
function signHash(hash, privateKey) {
	if (typeof privateKey === 'string') {
		privateKey = new PrivateKey(privateKey);
	}

	var ecdsa = new ECDSA();
	ecdsa.hashbuf = hash;
	ecdsa.privkey = privateKey;
	ecdsa.pubkey = privateKey.toPublicKey();
	ecdsa.signRandomK();
	ecdsa.calci();
	return ecdsa.sig.toCompact();
}
```

# Identity Validation

The platform protocol performs several forms of validation on identity create state transitions: structure validation and data validation.
 - Structure validation - only checks the content of the state transition
 - Data validation - takes the overall platform state into consideration

**Example:** An identity create state transition for an existing identity could pass structure validation; however, it would fail data validation since the identity already exists.

## Model Validation

### Identity Model

The identity model must pass validation tests as defined in [js-dpp](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/test/integration/identity/validation/validateIdentityFactory.spec.js). The test output below shows the necessary criteria:

```
Identity
  âœ“ should return invalid result if there are duplicate keys
  âœ“ should return invalid result if identity type is unknown
  id
    âœ“ should be present
    âœ“ should be a string
    âœ“ should not be less than 42 characters
    âœ“ should not be more than 44 characters
    âœ“ should be base58 encoded
  type
    âœ“ should be present
    âœ“ should be an integer
    âœ“ should be greater than 0
    âœ“ should be less than 65535
  publicKeys
    âœ“ should be present
    âœ“ should be an array
    âœ“ should not be empty
    âœ“ should throw an error if publicKeys have more than 100 keys
```

### Public Key Model

The public key model must pass validation tests as defined in [js-dpp](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/test/integration/identity/validation/validatePublicKeysFactory.spec.js). The test output below shows the necessary criteria:

```
PublicKeys
    âœ“ should return invalid result if there are duplicate key ids
    âœ“ should return invalid result if there are duplicate keys
    âœ“ should return invalid result if key data is not a valid DER
    id
      âœ“ should be present
      âœ“ should be a number
      âœ“ should be an integer
      âœ“ should be greater or equal to one
    type
      âœ“ should be present
      âœ“ should be a number
    data
      âœ“ should be present
      âœ“ should be a string
      âœ“ should be no less than 1 character
      âœ“ should be no longer than 2048 character
      âœ“ should be in base64 format
    isEnabled
      âœ“ should be present
      âœ“ should be a number
```

## State Transition Structure

Structure validation verifies that the content of state transition fields comply with the requirements for the field. The identity `type` and `publicKeys` fields are validated in this way and must pass validation tests as defined in [js-dpp](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/test/integration/identity/stateTransition/identityCreateTransition/validateIdentityCreateSTStructureFactory.spec.js). The test output below shows the necessary criteria:

```
validateIdentityCreateSTStructureFactory
  âœ“ should return invalid result if there are duplicate keys
  âœ“ should return invalid result if identity type is unknown
```

* See the [identity type section](#identity-type) for details regarding known identity types.

## State Transition Data

Data validation verifies that the data in the state transition is valid in the context of the current platform state. The state transition data must pass validation tests as defined in [js-dpp](https://github.com/dashevo/js-dpp/blob/v0.11.1/test/integration/identity/stateTransition/identityCreateTransition/validateIdentityCreateSTDataFactory.spec.js). The test output below shows the necessary criteria:

```
validateIdentityCreateSTDataFactory
   âœ“ should return invalid result if identity already exists
   âœ“ should return valid result if state transition is valid
```

**Note:** Additional validation rules will be added in future versions.
